Here are a few notebooks that I write as I am studying several topics in machine learning

- [ANN_classification_MNIST](https://github.com/andreavittino/colab_notebooks/blob/main/ANN_classification_MNIST.ipynb) : A classification of the MNIST dataset with a simple feed-forward neural network with fully-connected layers

- [CNN_classification_fashionMNIST](https://github.com/andreavittino/colab_notebooks/blob/main/CNN_classification_fashionMNIST.ipynb) : A classification of the fashion MNIST dataset with a convolutional neural network

- [CNN_classification_CIFAR10](https://github.com/andreavittino/colab_notebooks/blob/main/CNN_classification_CIFAR10.ipynb) : A classification of the CIFAR10 dataset with a convolutional neural network (with and without data augmentation)

- [CatsVsDogs](https://github.com/andreavittino/colab_notebooks/blob/main/CatsVsDogs.ipynb) : A classification of cats and dogs pictures with different convolutional neural network models of increasing complexity (with and without data augmentation, using a pretrained network vs. models built from scratch)

- [RNN_ImageClass_fashionMNIST](https://github.com/andreavittino/colab_notebooks/blob/main/RNN_ImageClass_fashionMNIST.ipynb) : Image classification (of the fashion MNIST dataset) performed with a recurrent neural network (LSTM)

- [RNN_SpamDetection](https://github.com/andreavittino/colab_notebooks/blob/main/RNN_SpamDetection.ipynb): e-mail classification (ham vs. spam) with a recurrent neural network (LSTM)
