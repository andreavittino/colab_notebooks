Here are a few notebooks that I write as I am studying several topics in machine learning

- [ANN_classification_MNIST](https://github.com/andreavittino/colab_notebooks/blob/main/ANN_classification_MNIST.ipynb) : A classification of the MNIST dataset with a simple feed-forward neural network with fully-connected layers

- [CNN_classification_fashionMNIST](https://github.com/andreavittino/colab_notebooks/blob/main/CNN_classification_fashionMNIST.ipynb) : A classification of the fashion MNIST dataset with a convolutional neural network

- [CNN_classification_CIFAR10](https://github.com/andreavittino/colab_notebooks/blob/main/CNN_classification_CIFAR10.ipynb) : A classification of the CIFAR10 dataset with a convolutional neural network (with and without data augmentation)
